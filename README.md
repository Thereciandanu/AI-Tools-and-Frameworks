AI Project: ML, Deep Learning & NLP Applications
This project demonstrates practical applications of classical machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) using Python frameworks. It includes theory, implementation, ethical considerations, and optional deployment.



Part 1: Theory 

TensorFlow vs PyTorch: Compared for use cases, ease, and production readiness.

Jupyter Notebooks: Used for interactive AI development and visualization.

spaCy Advantage: Performs NER and parsing beyond basic string operations.

Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow:

Scikit-learn: Easy for classical ML.

TensorFlow: Best for deep learning and scalability.



Part 2: Implementation 

Task 1 – Iris Dataset (Scikit-learn): Preprocessing, Decision Tree Classifier, accuracy/precision/recall.

Task 2 – MNIST CNN (TensorFlow/PyTorch): >95% accuracy, prediction visualizations.

Task 3 – Amazon Reviews (spaCy): Named Entity Recognition + rule-based sentiment analysis.


Part 3: Ethics & Debugging 

Discussed bias in MNIST and Amazon datasets.

Used TensorFlow Fairness Indicators and spaCy rules for mitigation.

Fixed a TensorFlow model with dimension and loss issues.


Live demo and screenshot included.
